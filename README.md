Support Nashville
==============
##What is it?
NashvilleCares is a Rails app that provides an easily navigable UI of social service programs for low income people.
It is designed as a mini content management system so many social workers can be given permissions to add services or service categories as they deem fit.

##Why?
There are currently no comprehensive databases of non-profit services for low income people.
Databases that do exist are convoluted and prohibitively complicated to navigate.
This application is designed to be as simple and easy to use as possible.

##What information does it provide?
This application provides very basic information about individual services.
* The name of the non-profit service provider.
* The service location.
* Contact phone number.
* A link to the non-profit's external website.
* A description of the non-profit.
* A summary of the services provided.
* A map showing with a pin marking the location of the non-profit.
